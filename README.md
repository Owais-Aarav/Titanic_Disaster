This is my first machine learning submission. I have used different classifiers and compared their accuracies . KNN, Random forest, Decision tree classifier, and gradient boosting classifier are found to be the highest accuracies models with 98.43%. A second highest accuracy model is a Support vector machine classifier with accuracy 89.9. Feedback are most welcome.Thank You
